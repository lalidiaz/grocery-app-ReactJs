# grocery-app-ReactJs ü•ù

This is the 10th project to refresh ReactJs concepts. I am writing an article about ReactJs main concepts so I can share it with the community once it's finished.

This is a grocery app, you can add items to the list, remove and modify the name of the item. If you refresh the items will be there still because I used Local Storage to store the items.
